# Tuples

Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data

Tuples may be constructed in a number of ways:

 *  Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple: `()`
 *  Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: `a,` or `(a,)`
 *  Separating items with commas: `a, b, c` or `(a, b, c)`
 *  Using the `tuple()` built-in: `tuple()` or `tuple(iterable)`

The constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the same order as *iterable*’s items.
 *iterable* may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object.
 If iterable is already a tuple, it is returned unchanged.
 For example,
* `tuple('abc')` returns `('a', 'b', 'c')` 
* `tuple( [1, 2, 3] )` returns `(1, 2, 3)`.

If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty tuple, `()`.

**Note:** It is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the parentheses. The parentheses are optional, except in the empty tuple case, or when they are needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity. 
For example, `f(a, b, c)` is a function call with three arguments, while `f((a, b, c))` is a function call with a 3-tuple as the sole argument.
